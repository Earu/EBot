    "When you see a ⏭ emote added under a video, join a voice channel and click it, the bot will then play the video!",
    "The bot can play variety of different audios, try playing something from Twitch or Youtube!",
    "You can report bugs or make feature request with the '**bug**' and '**feedback**' commands.",
    "Commands that are owner only can only be used by the developer of the bot.",
    "You can execute commands by mentioning the bot instead of using its prefix.",
    "Don't want anyone to see what commands you are trying out? Test them in DM!",
    "Made a typo in the command? Just edit your message, the bot will correct its result!",
    "Check the last changes made to the bot using the '**lastchanges**' command."
